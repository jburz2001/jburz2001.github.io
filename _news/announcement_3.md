I attended the NSF--sponsored <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/crg-spd/events/seattle-2025?authuser=0">2025 Structure--Preserving Scientific Computing and Machine Learning Summer School and Hackathon</a> at the University of Washington, Seattle from 06/16--06/25.
\\
While there I studied dynamical low--rank approximations, operator splitting, and physics--informed neural networks. Additionally, I worked with a scientist from <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/casc/computational-physics-group">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> to implement a physics--informed preconditioner for simulating X--ray radiative transport in inertial confiment fusion.
