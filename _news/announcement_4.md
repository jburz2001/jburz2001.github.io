I attended UC San Diego's 2025 UC LEADS summer session dinner reception on 07/01 as a recipient of the <a href="https://ucleads.ucop.edu/about/fellowship.html">UC LEADS graduate fellowship</a>.
\\
As an undergrad in UC LEADS I was awarded the 2022 <a href="https://ucleads.ucop.edu/symposium/poster-awards-2022.html">Graduate Deans' Leadership Award</a>, which is "given to three scholars who exhibited extraordinary leadership during their tenure as UC LEADS scholars" by the UC LEADS Executive Steering Committee and funded "by the deans of all 10 UC Graduate Divisions."
