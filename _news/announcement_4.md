I attended UC San Diego's 2025 UC LEADS summer session dinner reception on 07/01 as a recipient of the <a href="https://ucleads.ucop.edu/about/fellowship.html">UC LEADS graduate fellowship</a>.
\\
As an undergrad in UC LEADS I was awarded the 2022 <a href="https://ucleads.ucop.edu/symposium/poster-awards-2022.html">Graduate Deans' Leadership Award</a>, for "extraordinary leadership," funded by all 10 University of California Graduate Divisions.
