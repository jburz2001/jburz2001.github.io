My research interests span scientific machine learning, tensor algebra, and high-performance computing, with applications across science and engineering.

I interned at the Department of Energy’s [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/group/application-engineering) as a [SULI](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli) software engineer, where I developed verification and validation software for supercomputing. Later, I joined [VJ Technologies](https://vjt.com/) as an X-ray CT systems engineer intern, where I worked on Monte Carlo simulations of radiation transport, X-ray–based non-destructive testing, in addition to setting up CT machines and a particle accelerator.

Prior to beginning my PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of California, San Diego, I graduated magna cum laude with a B.S. in Physics from the University of California, Riverside, and earned an M.S. in Computational Applied Mathematics from Stony Brook University.
